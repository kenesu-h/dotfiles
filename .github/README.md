# dotfiles
tl;dr, contains configs for the following tools:

- git
- zsh
- tmux
- nvim

don't expect them to be sophisticated configs, nor wholly original since
they're based on Dreams of Code's [tmux config](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzNmUNvnB04)
and ThePrimeagen's [starter nvim config](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE)

the bootstrap script is designed for use on distros that use `zypper` (like
openSUSE). so you'll likely have to do things manually on other distros

# Setup 
1. install `yadm`
2. clone dotfiles using `yadm`
3. run `yadm bootstrap`
4. hope that nothing breaks
